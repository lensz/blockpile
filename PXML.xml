  PXML tag
  Indicates the root node of a PXML file.
 
  Attributes:
    xmlns:
      Identifies the namespace of this PXML file. Potential future PXML
      specifications will use a different name space.

  <!--
    application tag
    Declares a new application that this PND package provides. Most PND
    packages will only have one application entry, and it is discouraged to
    have too many application entries in one PND file, since a PND file is
    inseparable, i.e. an user cannot upgrade one app and leave another be if
    they share the same PND file.
 
    Attributes:
      id:
        Identifies the application in application enumerations.
        This has to be a string that is unique to the package series; there
        must not be two packages with entirely different purposes and
        origins that share the same ID.
 
        tl;dr: Choose an id like you would choose a package name on the
               Linux Desktop.
 
        Some things you have to consider when choosing an id:
          - If you release new versions of your application, they should have
            the same id as previous versions. Packages with different id's
            are not considered to be related at all, while packages with
            identical id's are considered to be of the same kind.
          - Your id should not be too complex. You should choose something
            that is unique to your application, and not something globally
            unique.
          - The application id will be used by package managers and the like.
            So, choose something that you expect to be typed in as:
            "installtool install %id%"
 
        If you are publishing an application that you created yourself,
        and that you don't expect anyone else to also publish, these
        would be GOOD id's:
          - "exaile"
          - "myapp"
          - "kdemod-extras-quassel"
          - "awesome-music-player"
 
        These would be BAD id's:
          - "Exaile" - This is an user-adapted name and not a machine-
            adapted name
          - "Exaile - A music player that rocks" - This contains spaces and
            might therefore be mistreated by shell scripts and the like.
          - "exaile-1.0" - This contains version information; you should
            put this information in the version tag below instead.
          - "exaile-written-by-foobar-in-the-year-of-the-lord-two-thousand-and-ten-and-given-to-yall-for-free"
            This is too long.
          - "ae4c8bc112cafedd" - This doesn't identify *the application*, but
            is just a random unique identifier.
        These would be GOOD id's if you PORTED or MODDED an existing
        application:
          - "exaile-dflemstr" - (port) The app was ported by dflemstr
          - "exaile-nox" - (mod) The app runs without X
          - "exaile-player" - (port) Only a part of the application was
            ported
          - "exaile-pure" - (mod) Substantial mods were carried through, and
            a rebranding was needed.
      appdata:
        Specifies a name for a data store for your application
        This is where all your writes to CWD will end up when you run
        your application. You should choose an user friendly name, but
        *not* an user-adapted name (think about localization and
        management).
        Good alternatives:
          - "exaile"
          - "exaile-1" - If you intend to release newer versions that use
            a different storage format.
          - "exaile-dev" - If you want an user to be able to use a dev
            version of your app, and a stable version of your app
            simultaneously.

    <!--
      title tag(s)
      Defines a human-readable title for the application in a specified locale.
      You MUST specify a title with the language "en_US"; other localizations
      are optional, but it is recommended to add one for generic,
      not-only-american english ("en"). Titles and descriptions should also be
      in pairs (you should not translate a title and omit a translation for a
      description).
 
      Attributes:
        lang:
          Specifies the language of the title.
 
          This is made up of two parts:
            - The language part. This code is the lower-case, two-letter
              code as defined by ISO-639.
            - OPTIONAL: The country part. This code is the upper-case,
              two-letter code as defined by ISO-3166, with an underscore
              as the prefix.

    <!--
      description tag(s)
      Defines a human-readable description for your application in a specified
      locale. The same rules apply to this element, as to title elements. Note
      that we by description don't mean page-long texts; the recommended length
      for a description is 128 characters, but certain implementations support
      up to 1024 or 4096 characters. More than that is absolutely not
      recommended. Also, please remember that newlines are ignored in
      descriptions according to the XML standard, but that spaces are
      significant. XML escaping applies for the characters less-than,
      greater-than and ampersand (&lt; &gt; &amp; respectively).

      version tag
      This specifies the version quadron for this application.
      ALL FIELDS MUST BE POSITIVE INTEGERS OR 0. You are free to choose your
      own versioning scheme (ie. "build" doesn't have to be the number of times
      you built the application), but you must specify all four version fields
      below.

    <!--
      exec tag
      Declares how the application should be started.
 
      Attributes:
        command:
          The executable to start when the program is launched. This is
          a path relative to the root of your PND file.
        arguments:
          Does the app need to be started with certain arguments every
          time it is run? This is useful for PNDs that contain
          multiple applications that use the same executable file.
          (specify the actual arguments, not true/false unless your app
          accepts true or false as arguments!)
        background:
          Can this application "be minimised" or should it run
          singleton?
          "true", "false", "1" or "0" accepted.
        startdir:
          Sets the CWD for the application before it is run.
          Default is the PND mount point.
        standalone:
          Can this application run directly, or should it only be
          started via associations? If this is "false" or "0", it
          won't show up in launchers.
        x11:
          Can be one of:
          "req" - X11 is required for the application to run.
          "stop" - X11 must be stopped for the application to run.
          "ignore" (default) - Don't care about X11.
      -->
    <exec command="./start.sh" background="false" standalone="true"/>
 
    <!--
      author tag
      Contains information about the application author. All three fields
      are optional.
 
      NOTE: If you type 'name=""', this won't mean that you left out the
      name! It only means that the name of the author is 0 characters
      long! Implementations will e.g. display an empty 'Author: ' field 
      if you do this!
 
      To leave out the name of the author, remove the attribute completely,
      and to leave out author information completely, remove the whole tag.

      icon tag
      Declares the icon for the application. This should be the same icon that
      is appended to the PND file, or something different if *this* application
      should have a different icon from the rest.
 
      Attributes:
        src:
          Relative URI to the icon (can be a relative file, or a
          fully-qualified URL; the latter is only supported in some
          implementations)
      -->

     categories tag
     Specifies which categories this application belongs to. See
     http://standards.freedesktop.org/menu-spec/latest/apa.html for more
     information. The optional sub-element "subcategory" is currently ignored
     by all implementations.
